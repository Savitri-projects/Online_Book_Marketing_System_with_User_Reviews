# BookHub: A comprehensive online book marketing system with user reviews

BookHub is a cutting-edge web application that streamlines online book marketing. It offers two main functions: a diverse book catalog with detailed pages for exploration and a marketing section featuring star authors, popular books, discounts, author subscriptions, and more. Notably, authors can easily contribute their work. **The system's robust database management, powered by Node.js, MySQL Workbench, and Express JS, ensures efficient data retrieval**.
